Redstone 3 is an alternative punk band based in Gran Canaria. Founded by Phil (bass/vocals) and Grischer (guitar/vocals), the band draws on decades of experience in the London, Bristol, Rome, and European underground scenes. Known for their high-energy sound and dual-lead approach, Redstone 3 features a rotating lineup of drummers and a cross-cultural blend of raw rock, punk, and grunge influences.


### Guitar/Vox

On guitar and vocals, the Italian- a rock 'n' roll virtuoso whose riffs are as fiery as his espresso and whose voice is smoother than a gondola ride at sunset.

### Bass/Vox

on bass—and also taking the mic when the mood strikes—the Austrian- bringing low-end thunder and riffs that could shake the Alps.

### Drums

On drums, a Englishman- a rhythm machine with the precision of Big Ben and the energy of a Friday night at the pub.
