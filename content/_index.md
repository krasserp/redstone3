### About 
Redstone 3 is a genre-bending collective of weathered souls and sonic architects who’ve lived many lives — from gritty tours across Europe to the fluorescent grind of overwork. Now based in Gran Canaria, they create emotionally raw, spiritually charged music rooted in grunge, post-rock, with ambient textures, and soul-first storytelling.

Formed by ex-city musicians who traded burnout for becoming, Redstone 3 explores inner peace, rebellion, love, and cosmic truth. With roots in Bristol, London, Vienna, Buenos Aries, Madrid and Rome, their sound is both global and grounded — dark and mysterious, yet hopeful and healing.

Redstone 3 isn’t just a band. It’s what happens when you remember who you were before the world got loud.
